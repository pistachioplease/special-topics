						<h2>Conditioning</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What is Conditioning?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">It has nothing to do with how far you can run, but it has everything to do with what you expect and what you want.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Conditioning is the fundamental principle that animals — including humans — will do something again if they are rewarded, and they will avoid doing it again if they are punished.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Rewards and Punishments are feelings, not things.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">The most effective rewards and punishments are free because they are feelings, not some random stuff.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Create a Feedback Loop</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Motivation > Action > Feedback > Motivation</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">For example, let’s say you took a cute picture of your baby. You are motivated to post it on Facebook so other people can see how cute your baby is. So you take action and post it.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Facebook had to design a way for you to take that action.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Then you get feedback from all the people who “Like” it and post compliments. You might even get an email about it.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Facebook had to design those ways of providing feedback too… which creates motivation to take another picture and do it again!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Be careful with punishments: The user should try to avoid punishments, so design your features that way. DON’T actively make your users feel bad</p>
						<p class="fragment">For example, there used to be a “farm game” — which shall not be named — where playing the game made your farm bigger and better over time (reward). If you stopped playing for too long, your crops would die (punishment). But… you could also pay to speed things up and get new stuff for your farm (big reward!)</p>

						<h2>Persuasion</h2>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Persuasion has 8 universal ingredients.</strong> They are usually most effective when done in order, because they build on each other.</p>
						<p class="fragment">strong{People are motivated by 14 things.} For the sake of brevity I will only discuss the 4 motivations that are most common in digital things.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Persuasion Formula: Before the Interaction</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Credibility</strong> — Without trust, everything else is irrelevant. In UX, this applies to everything from trustworthy branding, to transparency about your prices, to testimonies from customers. Don’t say you’re valuable; show them.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Know Your Audience</strong> —  In UX, that means you do your User Research so you know who you are persuading and what they care about.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Persuasion Formula: During the Interaction</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Open &amp; Disarm</strong> — You have to engage the user’s interest immediately, and then proceed to remove any obvious objections they might have. In UX this can be a great headline or an eye-catching image above the fold. If price is a concern, for example, that should be part of the first information the user can see. Don’t assume they will continue far enough to learn about it later.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Create Rapport</strong> — is the feeling of getting along with someone and it is created by similarities between people. In UX, this can be created by using familiar language, showing what the user has in common with your customers, or describing the main person in your article in a way that makes the reader relate to them.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Isolate — When a user has come far enough that their interest is clear, you want to remove any competing information. In UX that might mean removing the menu or banners during the checkout process so nothing distracts the user from their purchase.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Convince — For more complex persuasions, you may need to provide “waves” of information that leads the customer from the basics to the details, so they understand step-by-step. There are a variety of ways to do this. Cognitive Biases are often helpful to frame the information in a way that makes it easier to accept, and easier to consume.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Close the Deal — Just ask for commitment and don’t over-complicate it. In UX this is the “publish” button or the “confirm purchase” button, or the “share” button.</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Persuasion Formula: After the Interaction</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Summarize with Bias</strong> — Don’t let the persuasion end with the close! That makes people feel like you only value them until they give you what you want. In UX this might be a follow-up email to remind them about everything they can do with their new Macbook, or suggestions for more articles, or feedback about how many people liked/agreed with their post.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Universal Motiviations</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Status</strong> — is the main ingredient in gamification. Basically it is any way to measure yourself relative to other people.</p>
						<p class="fragment">When you design a system of points and trophies, or symbols of power and appreciation, you now control the perception of status for your users. It can be badges, likes, or levels in Candy Crush Saga. Users will be more motivated to feel superior to each other, and if you attach those achievements to your business goals, you will literally get money for nothing but feelings.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Universal Motiviations</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Affiliation</strong> — if you are a loyal fan of a sports team or a band, or if you feel proud to be part of a great organization or a special interest group, that is affiliation.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The reason people join Facebook groups, or dress a certain way, or do a test to find out “Which celebrity are you?!” is because they are motivated to belong to things. Design somewhere for people to belong, and watch your users identify themselves into groups or categories.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Universal Motiviations</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Justice</strong> — is the idea of fairness or “getting what you deserve” whether that means a reward or a punishment.</p>
						<p class="fragment">It’s why we cry for people that get no respect and then have amazing operatic voices on Britain’s Got Talent, and why Justin Bieber haters love watching him get arrested. Design a way to help underdogs get noticed, or for the crowd to find evil and destroy it, and they will.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Universal Motiviations</h3>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Understanding</strong> — People are motivated to learn more (and even feel they deserve to know more) about anything that involves large doses of the motivations above. </p>
						<p class="fragment">However, it is a lot more practical than that. If you try to change something that took time to learn, like the design of your interface, people might be enraged. Remember the groups of people with pitchforks and torches after Facebook did a major re-design? Exactly.</p>

						<h2>How Experience Changes Experience</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Power Users are the Minority</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Statistically-speaking, it is impossible for advanced or power users to be “most” of the people using your design. Although it can be very tempting to believe that.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Hard truth:</strong> If you want millions of happy users, design for the distracted idiots, not the obsessed geniuses.</p>
						<!-- silicon valley video -->
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Hidden vs. Visible: The Paradox of Choice</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Visible features will always be used more and discovered more than hidden features. We are reminded that they exist every time we see them.</p>
						<p class="fragment">However, the “Paradox of Choice” says: the more options you see, the less likely you are to choose any of them. So if you overload normal users with too many choices, they will freak out and run away screaming.</p>					
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Make sure beginners can find the core features easily. Ideally, without clicking anything. And try to give power users easy access to advanced features, even if they aren’t visible all the time.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Recognition vs. Memory</h3>
						<p class="fragment">How many different icons could you name off the top of your head, right now?</p>
						<p class="fragment">How many could you recognize if I gave you a list?</p>
						<p class="fragment">If you’re a normal human, the second answer would be a lot more.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">If you design your interface so people have to ask for something — like search — they will only use the features they can remember. That means that, over time, they will use fewer and fewer features. Not more and more.</p>
						<p class="fragment">If your users are forced to deal with a large amount of information, give them some suggestions of categories or some other kind of help to remind them where to look!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Learning is Slow. Habits are fast.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">“Onboarding” is the word we use to describe the step-by-step lessons, or very simple introductions to a new interface. It helps new users find the main features easily, and avoid confusion.</p>
