						<h2>UX vs UI</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What is UI?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">User interface involves elements that "interface" between a computer and a user.</p>
						<p class="fragment">User Interface Design deals with the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<blockqoute>
							If you imagine a product as the human body, the bones represent the code which give it structure. The organs represent the UX design: measuring and optimizing against input for supporting life functions. And UI design represents the cosmetics of the body–its presentation, its senses and reactions.
						</blockqoute>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Confused still?</h3>
						<blockquote class="fragment">
							User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success. - Rahul Varshney, Co-creator of Foster.fm

						<h2>What is User Experience Design?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">process of enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty by improving usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the customer and the product.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, is credited with inventing the term in the late 1990’s</p>

						<h2>"Doing" UX involves</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Researching to understand users</li>
							<li>Developing ideas to solve user's needs - and the needs of the business</li>
							<li>Building and measuring solutions in the real world to see if they work</li>

						<h2>User Goals and Business Goals</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>User Goals</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Users always want something.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Users want to do something productive (or not).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Business Goals</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Every organization has a reason for creating an app.  It might be for money, brand awareness, or getting new members for a community.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Often called "metrics" or "KPI's" by business folks.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">UX designers should align those goals so the business benefits when the user reaches their goal.</p>
						<p class="fragment">If YouTube made you watch 60 seconds of ads for every 30 seconds of videos, they would die a quick, painful death.</p>

						<h2>The 5 Main Ingredients of UX</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Psychology</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Understanding how a user's mind works. (subsconcious)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Psychology: ask yourself</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?</li>
							<li>How does this make them feel?</li>
							<li>How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?</li>
							<li>What habits are created if they do this over and over?</li>
							<li>What do they expect when they click this?</li>
							<li>Are you assuming they know something that they haven’t learned yet?</li>
							<li>Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?</li>					
							<li>Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?</li>
							<li>How are you rewarding good behaviour?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Usability</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Know when something is confusing. If it leads users. (conscious)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Usability: ask yourself</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Could you get the job done with less input from the user?</li>
							<li>Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)</li>
							<li>Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?</li>
							<li>Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?</li>
							<li>Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?</li>
							<li>Have you provided everything the user needs to know?</li>
							<li>Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?</li>
							<li>Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you know?</li>
							<li>If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Design</h3>
						<p class="fragment">In UX, design is how it works, and it’s something you can prove; it’s not a matter of style. It doesn't have to be super pretty.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Design: ask yourself</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?</li>
							<li>Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?</li>
							<li>Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?</li>
							<li>Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?</li>
							<li>Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?</li>
							<li>Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Copywriting (?)</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Brand copy supports the image of the company. UX copy gets things done as directly and simply as possible.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Copywriting: ask yourself</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?</li>
							<li>Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?</li>
							<li>Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?</li>
							<li>Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?</li>
							<li>Does it reduce anxiety?</li>
							<li>Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Analysis</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Using data to see if a user's experience is pleasant.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Analysis: ask yourself</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?</li>
							<li>Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?</li>
							<li>Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?</li>
							<li>Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?</li>
							<li>Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements?</li>
							<li>How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?</li>
							<li>Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?</li>
							<li>How can you use this analysis to make improvements?</li>
						</ul>
